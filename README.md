# MyReads Project

This is the first project assignment for **Udacity's React Nanodegree.**

Its goal is to organize your books into bookshelves (currently reading, want to read, read) as well as search and add new books from the API.

It uses all the cool features of React:
* Routing with router
* Components, both stateless and stateful
* One-way data-binding (unidirectional data flow) from parent to children
* State management through state and props
* JSX
* Event handlers

## TL;DR

To get the app running in development server right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
